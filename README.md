# 📊 Laptop Price Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate laptop prices based on various specifications such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and screen size.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── Data_Science.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook containing full analysis and model training
├── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 Model Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Model training with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluation with RMSE, R², etc.

## 📈 Sample Output

- Mean Absolute Error: *...*
- R² Score: *...*
- Prediction example: *Brand: Dell, i7, 16GB → Rp X juta*

(*You can update these values after running the model.*)
